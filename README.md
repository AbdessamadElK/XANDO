# XANDO
### XANDO (X and O): a small python application to generate datasets of positive and negative points on a plan.
This super simple application written on **python** using the **pygame library** is meant to generate simple datasets with two feature (coordinates X1 and X2) and a logic
label (y). It was developped just to generate Datasets for a class project about ***Single layer and Multi layer Perceptron***.

## How to use it?
The use of this application is pretty simple:
1. To **add** a point, click anywhere on the gray canvas
2. To **switch** between Positive and Negative **classes**, use **P** and **N** keys.
3. To **remove** a point, **right-click** on it.
4. To **clear** the canvas, press **R**.
5. To **save** the dataset, press **S**.

You can find the generated Dataset in the same directory where the XANDO.exe is placed. The generated file (Data Y-M-D-HMS.txt) contains comma separated values (X1, X2, y) for each point of the Dataset. It can be directly loaded to matlab using *load()* function.

## Where to find it?
you can download it from Google Drive:
